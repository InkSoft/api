# api
Sample code and wiki documentation for implementing the InkSoft API

* common - has utilities that all API code shares
* product-catalog - sample HTML page that calls the GetProductCategoryList and GetProductList APIs to create a simple product catalog page

For simplicity, all examples use [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to render the API results to HTML.
